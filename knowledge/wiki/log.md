# Operation log

Append-only. Add new entries at the bottom. Never edit or delete a past entry — if a past
entry turns out to be wrong, add a new entry that says so and points at the correction.

## 2026-09-02T00:00:00Z — initial wiki creation

- **Operation type:** initial ingestion + foundation build
- **Source material ingested:**
  [`knowledge/raw/product/initial-product-concept.md`](../raw/product/initial-product-concept.md)
  (the full original product/architecture brief, including the mid-session LLM Wiki
  addendum), and the foundation-phase build itself, recorded in
  [`knowledge/raw/sessions/2026-09-02-foundation-build.md`](../raw/sessions/2026-09-02-foundation-build.md).
- **Wiki pages created:** all of `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, `wiki/product/*` (4 pages),
  `wiki/domain/*` (5 pages), `wiki/engineering/*` (5 pages) — the full initial structure.
- **Decisions/contradictions recorded:** none yet contradicted — this is the first pass, so
  every wiki page's "Confirmed decisions" section simply reflects the brief and the
  foundation-phase build. Open questions were recorded directly on the relevant pages
  (see `domain/family-spaces.md` re: personal custom categories,
  `engineering/data-model.md` re: recurrence materialization,
  `domain/privacy-and-availability.md` re: RLS tests not existing yet) rather than forcing
  premature resolution.
- **Responsible agent:** Claude (Sonnet 5, via Claude Code).
