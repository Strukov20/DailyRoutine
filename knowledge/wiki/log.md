## 2026-09-02T00:00:00Z — initial wiki creation

- **Operation type:** initial ingestion + foundation build
- **Source material ingested:**
  [`knowledge/raw/product/initial-product-concept.md`](../raw/product/initial-product-concept.md)
  (the full original product/architecture brief, including the mid-session LLM Wiki
  addendum), and the foundation-phase build itself, recorded in
  [`knowledge/raw/sessions/2026-09-02-foundation-build.md`](../raw/sessions/2026-09-02-foundation-build.md).
- **Wiki pages created:** all of `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, `wiki/product/*` (4 pages),
  `wiki/domain/*` (5 pages), `wiki/engineering/*` (5 pages) — the full initial structure.
- **Decisions/contradictions recorded:** none yet contradicted — this is the first pass, so
  every wiki page's "Confirmed decisions" section simply reflects the brief and the
  foundation-phase build. Open questions were recorded directly on the relevant pages
  (see `domain/family-spaces.md` re: personal custom categories,
  `engineering/data-model.md` re: recurrence materialization,
  `domain/privacy-and-availability.md` re: RLS tests not existing yet) rather than forcing
  premature resolution.

## 2026-09-02T00:00:00Z — Phase 2: Supabase foundation, schema, RLS, authentication

- **Operation type:** implementation + wiki update
- **Source material ingested:**
  [`knowledge/raw/sessions/2026-09-02-phase2-supabase-foundation.md`](../raw/sessions/2026-09-02-phase2-supabase-foundation.md).
- **Wiki pages created:** `engineering/authentication.md` (new).
- **Wiki pages updated:** `engineering/security-model.md`, `engineering/data-model.md`,
  `engineering/testing-strategy.md`, `engineering/system-architecture.md`,
  `domain/privacy-and-availability.md`, `domain/family-spaces.md`,
  `domain/tasks-and-assignments.md`, `domain/events-and-responsibilities.md`,
  `wiki/index.md` (added the new authentication page).
- **Decisions/contradictions recorded:**
  - A real design gap in Phase 1's proposed `SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md` Mechanism 2
    (`security_invoker` sanitized view) was found while implementing it — a
    `security_invoker` view would inherit base-table RLS's non-owner block and could never
    show a Busy block for a private item. Corrected to an ordinary (owner-executed) view
    whose own `WHERE` clause is the authorization check. Recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`,
    `docs/SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md`, and `engineering/security-model.md` /
    `domain/privacy-and-availability.md` — not silently patched.
  - Schema additions beyond the original `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` proposal (denormalized
    `family_id` on family-scoped child tables, `timezone` columns, no native Postgres enums,
    a validating rather than syncing owner-consistency trigger) are documented in
    `docs/DECISIONS.md` and referenced from the relevant wiki pages rather than silently
    applied.
  - **Unresolved, carried forward**: whether the pgTAP suite and local Supabase auth flow
    were actually verified against a live Postgres instance this session depends on whether
    Docker finished installing in time — see the session source and the final report for the
    answer. If not verified, treat `supabase/migrations/` and `supabase/tests/` as
    reasoned-through but not yet proven, until `npm run db:reset && npm run db:test` is run
    for real.
  - No family-creation RPC exists yet — flagged in `domain/family-spaces.md` and
    `engineering/data-model.md` as a hard prerequisite for Phase 3, not silently deferred.
- **Responsible agent:** Claude (Sonnet 5, via Claude Code).
